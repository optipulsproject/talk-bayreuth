This module contains an optimization problem setup (i.e. optimization environment) used for every computation in the paper. Reading parameters form a common external module prevents prevents repetition of code snippets and as a consequence prevents errors due to desynchronization of parameters.

Notice, that the correct behavior is guaranteed only with `optcontrol-manuscript` branch of `optipuls` module.
